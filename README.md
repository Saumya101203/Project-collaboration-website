# Project Collaboration Website for College Projects

This project collaboration website is designed to facilitate seamless collaboration among students and faculty within a college environment. It integrates with the college's database, where user credentials (email and password) are securely stored in a users table. Users can log in using their registered email and password, ensuring secure access to the platform.

Upon successful login, users gain access to a comprehensive list of ongoing projects across various departments. Each project listing includes essential details such as project name, subject, and a brief description. Users can easily navigate through projects and express interest by clicking an "Interested" button located conveniently below each project description.

Additionally, the platform features an "Add Project" button that allows any user to submit their project for inclusion on the main projects page. This functionality promotes inclusivity and enables students and faculty to showcase their initiatives to the college community.

The website also includes a robust notification system. When a user expresses interest in a project, the system notifies the project owner via a dedicated notifications page. This feature ensures efficient communication and collaboration between project owners and potential collaborators.

Overall, this platform enhances project visibility, fosters collaboration, and streamlines project management within the college, providing a dynamic environment for innovation and teamwork.
